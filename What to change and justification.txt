Fisherman
- Boat number <- registered boat (limitation: not representing unregistered)
- many fisherman per boat

- 2 main types (exclude IMUL since we focus on coastal fisheries, cite the monsoon bring pollution to coast) 
	- generalize 2 main types: 
		1. OFRP
		2. NTRB
- we don't consider time of year
- we assume they go every day, since FRP boat go out 23 days/month (Wijayaratne, 2001)
- we assume everyone is boat owner, despite the fact that there are i.) owner, ii.) worker but they earn quite similarity (2.2 socio-economic... Wijayaratne, 2001)

	- Behavior
		1. pay what??
		2. fish search behavior
			- IMUL have radar
			- Small scale fisherman ??
		3. do amount of fisherman increase ?? -- IF WE HAVE TIME
			- Generational link; (not much change of number) (Wijayaratne, 2001)
			- Market dynamic
				- 5$ -- we set the prod. and fish so that profits hit 5$
				- if pollution hits
					- how much $ will be reduced
		4. Fisherman goes out
		5. Fish an amount (calibrate the profit/kg so that on average 

	- Remove Happy_end / Bad_end
		- We don't model this since people don't stop fishing even when they reach financial freedom, they will just keep doing it profitably 
		- Even when the fisherman is in debt, they will keep fishing under loan (groundviews, 2025)
	- We measure the accum profitability of fisherman
		1. fisherman number with <0 money and >0 money
		2. amount of loan
		3. amount of money



Environment
- area that got hit
	1. Colombo
	2. Negombo	<- data from 
		- 

Pollution
	- How much pollution is released for one accident	
		- 1680 tons
		- spread of 5 days  (fan shaped toward the land and move)
		- natural decay of something (fish eat it and dies)
			- the patch that hit the land, pollution subside
	- How it affect the fish reproduction rate?
		- ???
	- How long it take for pollution (it still there after 10 years, )



Fish
	- How many fish will a fisherman catch / day = to get 5$ profits a day
	- reproduction (reproduction = death + caught; under normal condition)
		- reproduction rate
		- death rate -> increase when pollution is there
		- caught rate
